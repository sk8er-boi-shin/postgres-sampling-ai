# 1. Input/Output Specifications

This section outlines the main input and output specifications of the tool.  
It assumes execution as a CLI tool and includes settings files, DB connection info, AI inference I/O, logs, etc.

### Input Specifications

| Category           | Description                                        | Format / Example                            | Notes |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| Query              | Target SQL query (common to learning and apply phases) | `SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount > 1000;`  | Specified in config file or script (flexible) â€»1 |
| Target DB Info     | DB connection details (host, port, user, dbname, etc.) | JSON or .env                               | Plaintext storage not recommended for security |
| Sampling Criteria  | Settings for target tables to be sampled          | YAML / JSON format                           | Includes exclusion schemas and thresholds |
| Trained Model      | Model file used during apply phase                | `best_model.pkl`                             | Generated after learning phase |
| Metrics            | Stats from PostgreSQL system catalogs             | `pg_stat_all_tables`, `pg_stats`, etc.       | Retrieved automatically; no manual input required |
| Execution Mode     | Mode to control execution behavior (e.g., normal) | `--mode run`                                 | dry-run mode considered for future support â€»2 |

â€»1: To ensure reproducibility and accuracy, query input methods should be flexible depending on the context.  
Execution environment and conditions are omitted in this document for simplicity.

â€»2: Currently, execution is fully controlled by the Python logic.  
Full prevention of stats updates via dry-run is partially limited.  
Future enhancements may include modes limited to `EXPLAIN` or outputting logs only.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| Execution Logs      | Logs of results, estimated row counts, etc.         | `execution_20240624.log`                    | Log rotation/compression planned |
| Estimated Results   | Estimated sampling row count per table              | CSV or JSON                                | Format: `table_name,estimated_rows` |
| ANALYZE Results     | Success/failure of ANALYZE, execution time, etc.    | JSON or embedded in log                    | Example: `{"status":"success","time":2.13}` |
| EXPLAIN/Stats History | EXPLAIN results for executed queries              | CSV or DB table                            | Used in model retraining |
| Error Output        | Error information during processing                 | stderr or log file                         | Includes retry-eligible flag |
| Model File          | Trained regression model, etc.                      | `best_model.pkl`                            | Expected formats: joblib/pickle via scikit-learn |


### Notes

- All input/output files use UTF-8 encoding.
- Output destinations for model files and statistics can be changed via `config.yaml` or CLI options.
- For future cloud integration (e.g., S3), output destinations like `s3://` URIs will be supported.

# 2. module structure

This section describes the module structure that supports the main processing phases (learning phase / application phase) of this tool.  
Each module is clearly separated by responsibility, aiming for an architecture that allows easy future extensions or replacements.



### Learning Phase (PoC / Development Environment)

| Module Name            | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `metrics_collector.py` | Collects table statistics (e.g., from pg_stat, pg_class) used in the query |
| `sampling_estimator.py`| Estimates sampling row counts using AI (regression model) based on collected stats |
| `analyze_executor.py`  | Executes `ANALYZE` using the estimated value to update statistics     |
| `plan_logger.py`       | Retrieves and logs the execution plan and elapsed time after query execution |
| `model_trainer.py`     | Trains a regression model using the results and saves it as a `.pkl` file |



### Application Phase (Production or Operational Use)

| Module Name            | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `metrics_collector.py` | Collects metrics (same as in the learning phase)                     |
| `model_loader.py`      | Loads the trained model and performs estimation                      |
| `analyze_executor.py`  | Executes `ANALYZE` with estimated rows (dry-run mode also considered) |



### Common / Supporting Modules

| Module Name            | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `logger.py`            | Outputs logs for execution results, errors, and estimation values    |
| `config_loader.py`     | Loads configuration files (YAML/JSON) and manages common parameters  |
| `query_parser.py`      | Extracts target tables from a given SQL query                        |
| `error_handler.py`     | Handles errors (retry, skip, notify, etc.)                           |
| `constants.py`         | Manages threshold values and constants centrally                     |



### Planned Extensions (Future Vision)

| Tentative Module Name  | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `ui_adapter.py`        | Converts model results and stats for visual representation           |
| `job_scheduler.py`     | Manages scheduled/batch jobs (cron or CI/CD integration)             |


> Responsibilities of each module will be further refined in the detailed design phase.  
> Python package structure (e.g., `/modules/`, `/utils/`) and dependency design will also be addressed during implementation.
