# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the basic design of a tool that improves the efficiency of statistics update processing in PostgreSQL by automatically determining the optimal number of sampling rows using AI.

In PostgreSQL, statistics are used for query optimization, but updating them requires executing `ANALYZE`. The processing time and accuracy can vary significantly depending on the size and characteristics of the target tables. This project aims to design a mechanism to address the following challenges:

- Long execution times of `ANALYZE` on large tables  
- Suboptimal execution plans caused by outdated or inconsistent statistics  
- Lack of adaptive sampling strategies based on update frequency and data characteristics  
- Handling of partitioned or fragmented tables  
- Variability due to delayed updates or estimates in `pg_stat` system views  

This design document details the system architecture, processing flow, input/output specifications, and the logic used to dynamically calculate sampling row counts using AI.

The tool will begin as a locally executable script for proof-of-concept (PoC) purposes, with future plans to support scalable execution in cloud environments and potential integration with a web-based UI.
